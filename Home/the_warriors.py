"""You need to create the class Warrior, the instances of which will have 2 parameters - health (equal to 50 points)
and attack (equal to 5 points), and 1 property - is_alive, which can be True (if warrior's health is > 0) or False (
in the other case). In addition you have to create the second unit type - Knight, which should be the subclass of the
Warrior but have the increased attack - 7. Also you have to create a function fight(), which will initiate the duel
between 2 warriors and define the strongest of them. The duel occurs according to the following principle: every turn
one of the warriors will hit another one and the last will lose his health in the same value as the attack of the
first warrior. After that, the second warrior will do the same to the first one. If in the end of the turn the first
warrior has > 0 health and the other one doesnâ€™t, the function should return True, in the other case it should return
False.

Input: The warriors.
Output: The result of the duel (True or False).
Precondition: 2 types of units"""
